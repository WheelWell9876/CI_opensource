Okay, good work, this is a good start. Now I just need to fix up some of the shortcomings. I can index the datasets that are selected for editing, and it does take me to the next stage. However, the values that were already selected as loaded inside the dataset fields are not highlighted as they should be. When a dataset or category or feature layers is loaded to be edited, I want to have the fields that were previously selected in the config to be already selected. Once the user has selected or deselected any of the old or new fields, the next stage should show the weights and values of the attributes for all of these fields as well. These fields and attributes should have all of the previously entered in values for these things as they are present in the config file. This should also happen for the category and feature layer creation. When a category is selected to be edited, I want to have the datasets that are located in this config to be pre-selected and highlighted in the dataset selection stage. Then for when the weighting of datasets stage, the previously made configs for these datasets should be there as well. Same thing for the feature layer in keeping these values for the categories. I have uploaded a config file as one of the things that is made as an example. 

Also, another major issue that I am experiencing is the fact that when I am finished creating a dataset or category or feature layer the preview is showing the previously created dataset or previously edited dataset. The preview is only being shown for the dataset but not for the category and feature layers, the category contains the datasets and then the feature layer contains the categories which contain the dataset, and so the python code, schema, samples, and statistics should be present in all of these three modes although the functionality for that does not exist yet for the category and feature layer. 

Another big issue that I am having is the fact that I am unable to create another dataset after creating one without reloading the page.
